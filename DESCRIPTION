Description: This sofware package provides facilities for GLMM-MiRKAT/aGLMM-MiRKAT which tests the association betweem microbial community (e.g., bacterial kingdom) composition and a host trait of interest (e.g., health/disease status, medical intervention, behavioral/environmental factor) based on correlated (e.g., family-based or longitudinal) microbiome studies. For the host trait of interest, Gaussian (e.g., body mass index), Binomial (e.g., disease status, treatment/placebo) or Poisson (e.g., number of tumors/treatments) traits can be handled.
